By relying on DPI systems, Internet service providers may apply different charging policies, traffic shaping, or offer quality of service (QoS) guarantees to selected users or applications. As critical network services rely on the precise characterization of network flows, building agile and efficient DPI systems has recently become an important research topic. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature review on the tools and techniques necessary to develop modern DPI systems. We provide the essential technical background material and examine the current body of research in DPI engines' optimization for commodity platforms. Then we discuss current research challenges and present guidelines for building high performance DPI systems.},

We present here a traffic classifier that can achieve a high accuracy across a range of application types without any source or destination host-address or port information. We use supervised machine learning based on a Bayesian trained neural network. Though our technique uses training data with categories derived from packet content, training and testing were done using features derived from packet streams consisting of one or more packet headers. By providing classification without access to the contents of packets, our technique offers wider application than methods that require full packet/payloads for classification. This is a powerful advantage, using samples of classified traffic to permit the categorization of traffic based only upon commonly available information},

Applications such as traffic classification and policing require real-time and scalable approaches. Anomaly detection and security mechanisms require to quickly identify and react to unpredictable events while processing millions of heterogeneous events. At last, the system has to collect, store, and process massive sets of historical data for post-mortem analysis. Those are precisely the challenges faced by general big data approaches: Volume, Velocity, Variety, and Veracity. This survey brings together NTMA and big data. We catalog previous work on NTMA that adopt big data approaches to understand to what extent the potential of big data is being explored in NTMA. This survey mainly focuses on approaches and technologies to manage the big NTMA data, additionally briefly discussing big data analytics (e.g., machine learning) for the sake of NTMA. Finally, we provide guidelines for future work, discussing lessons learned, and research directions.},

  abstract = {To filter SSL/TLS-protected traffic, some antivirus and parental-control applications interpose a TLS proxy in the middle of the host's communications. We set out to analyze such proxies as there are known problems in other (more matured) TLS processing engines, such as browsers and common TLS libraries. Compared to regular proxies, client-end TLS proxies impose several unique constraints, and must be analyzed for additional attack vectors; e.g., proxies may trust their own root certificates for externally-delivered content and rely on a custom trusted CA store (bypassing OS/browser stores). Covering existing and new attack vectors, we design an integrated framework to analyze such client-end TLS proxies. Using the framework, we perform a thorough analysis of eight antivirus and four parentalcontrol applications for Windows that act as TLS proxies, along with two additional products that only import a root certificate. Our systematic analysis uncovered that several of these tools severely affect TLS security on their host machines. In particular, we found that four products are vulnerable to full server impersonation under an active man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack out-of-the-box, and two more if TLS filtering is enabled. Several of these tools also mislead browsers into believing that a TLS connection is more secure than it actually is, by e.g., artificially upgrading a server's TLS version at the client. Our work is intended to highlight new risks introduced by TLS interception tools, which are possibly used by millions of users.},

In the area, 59.63\% of the total deposition fluxes of the Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were observed in the wet season (March to July). Lower total fluxes of HMs were observed at the rural site. Principal component analysis (PCA) results showed that the As, Cd, Pb, and Zn might originate from the same anthropogenic sources, including traffic and industrial sources, and that the Cr, Cu, and Ni might come from natural sources. Correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that rainfall, wind speed, and PMs were critical factors influencing the atmospheric bulk deposition of HMs. For the paddy soil, the input fluxes of HMs by deposition, accounted for 38.66--84.57\% (except for Cr) of the total input fluxes. The prediction indicated that the accumulation of HMs in surface soil will notably increase over the next decades due to the influence of atmospheric deposition.},

Among the factors that prevent a comparison are the difficulties to share a dataset, the lack of a good dataset, the absence of a proper description of the methods and the lack of a comparison methodology. This paper compares the output of three different botnet detection methods by executing them over a new, real, labeled and large botnet dataset. This dataset includes botnet, normal and background traffic. The results of our two methods (BClus and CAMNEP) and BotHunter were compared using a methodology and a novel error metric designed for botnet detections methods. We conclude that comparing methods indeed helps to better estimate how good the methods are, to improve the algorithms, to build better datasets and to build a comparison methodology.},

  abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) are effectively utilized in various complicated challenges in healthcare, industry, and academia. The Internet of Drones (IoD) has lately cropped up due to high adjustability to a broad range of unpredictable circumstances. In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could be utilized efficiently in a multitude of scenarios, including rescue missions and search, farming, mission-critical services, surveillance systems, and so on, owing to technical and realistic benefits such as low movement, the capacity to lengthen wireless coverage zones, and the ability to attain places unreachable to human beings. In many studies, IoD and UAV are utilized interchangeably. Besides, drones enhance the efficiency aspects of various network topologies, including delay, throughput, interconnectivity, and dependability. Nonetheless, the deployment of drone systems raises various challenges relating to the inherent unpredictability of the wireless medium, the high mobility degrees, and the battery life that could result in rapid topological changes. In this paper, the IoD is originally explained in terms of potential applications and comparative operational scenarios. Then, we classify ML in the IoD-UAV world according to its applications, including resource management, surveillance and monitoring, object detection, power control, energy management, mobility management, and security management. This research aims to supply the readers with a better understanding of (1) the fundamentals of IoD/UAV, (2) the most recent developments and breakthroughs in this field, (3) the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, and (4) areas that need further investigation and consideration. The results suggest that the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method is the most often employed ML method in publications. According to research, most papers are on resource and mobility management. Most articles have focused on enhancing only one parameter, with the accuracy parameter receiving the most attention. Also, Python is the most commonly used language in papers, accounting for 90\% of the time. Also, in 2021, it has the most papers published.},

For example, a denial-of-service attack on a centralized controller that manages a large network of several network devices (routers, switches, etc.) is more destructive than a targeted attack against a router. A spoofed SDN controller could allow a hacker to control an entire network, while a spoofed router could only harm the proper functioning of the traffic routed through that router. The SDN is facing these new security challenges, especially on securing the SDN architecture itself. SDN security is ensured at all these levels based on three-layer architecture and programming interfaces, which poses several challenges. The SDN's security challenges are expected to grow with the progressive deployment. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of state of the art, accompanied by categorizing the research literature into a taxonomy that highlights each proposal's main characteristics and contributions to the SDN's different layers. Based on the analysis of existing work, we also highlight key research gaps that could support future research in this area.},

Therefore, network traffic monitoring and analysis have become essential in order to troubleshoot and resolve problems effectively when they occur, so that network services do not stand still for long durations of time. Traffic monitoring is a technique which constantly monitors the network traffic and notifies the administrator whenever there is an outage. There are many network monitoring tools available for network administrators, which use different monitoring techniques in order to monitor and analyze network traffic.

Switch vendors have added progressively more monitoring features to switches, but the current trajectory of adding specific features is unsustainable given the ever-changing demands of network operators. Instead, we ask what switch hardware primitives are required to support an expressive language of network performance questions. We believe that the resulting switch hardware design could address a wide variety of current and future performance monitoring needs.},

  abstract = {Traffic analysis is a compound of strategies intended to find relationships, patterns, anomalies, and misconfigurations, among others things, in Internet traffic. In particular, traffic classification is a subgroup of strategies in this field that aims at identifying the application's name or type of Internet traffic. Nowadays, traffic classification has become a challenging task due to the rise of new technologies, such as traffic encryption and encapsulation, which decrease the performance of classical traffic classification strategies. Machine learning (ML) gains interest as a new direction in this field, showing signs of future success, such as knowledge extraction from encrypted traffic, and more accurate Quality of Service management. ML is fast becoming a key tool to build traffic classification solutions in real network traffic scenarios; in this sense, the purpose of this investigation is to explore the elements that allow this technique to work in the traffic classification field. Therefore, a systematic review is introduced based on the steps to achieve traffic classification by using ML techniques. The main aim is to understand and to identify the procedures followed by the existing works to achieve their goals. As a result, this survey paper finds a set of trends derived from the analysis performed on this domain; in this manner, the authors expect to outline future directions for ML-based traffic classification.},

Nevertheless, there is an increasing number of abusive cryptomining cases, and it is reported that ``coin miner malware'' grew by more than 4000\% in 2018. In this work, we analyzed the cryptominer network communication and proposed the DeCrypto system that can detect and report mining on high-speed 100~Gbps backbone Internet lines with millions of users. The detector uses the concept of heterogeneous weak-indication detectors (Machine-Learning-based, domain-based, and payload-based) that work together and create a robust and accurate detector with an extremely low false-positive rate. The detector was implemented and evaluated on a real nationwide high-speed network and proved efficient in a real-world deployment.},

More general, cyber physical systems include all equipments operated on preprogrammed instructions ranging from simple electronic devices to the ultra-modern warfare equipments along with life saving devices. Active cyber-attacks can cause cyber warfare situations by disrupting an entire community of people, which in turn raises an emergency situation to the nation. Thus, cyber warfare is a major threat to the nation at large. In this paper, we analyze the various aspects of cyber warfare situations and a survey on ongoing attacks, defense and cyber forensics strategies in that field. Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging computing area which enables Machine to Machine communication in cyber physical systems. An attack on IoT causes major issues to the security on the devices and thus, the various threats and attacks on IoT are analyzed here. Overall monitoring and data acquisition in cyber physical systems is done by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems and are mainly targeted by the attackers in order to leave the cyberspace applications not functioning. Therefore, the various threats, attacks and research issues pertaining to the cyberspace are surveyed in this paper along with a few research issues and challenges that are to be solved in the area of cyber warfare.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of large-scale complex networks and proliferation of various social network applications, the amount of network traffic data generated is increasing tremendously, and efficient anomaly detection on those massive network traffic data is crucial to many network applications, such as malware detection, load balancing, network intrusion detection. Although there are many methods around for network traffic anomaly detection, they are all designed for single machine, failing to deal with the case that the network traffic data are so large that it is prohibitive for a single computer to store and process the data. To solve these problems, we propose a parallel algorithm based on Isolation Forest and Spark for network traffic anomaly detection. We combine the advantages of Isolation Forest algorithm in network traffic anomaly detection and big data processing capability of Spark technology. Meanwhile, we apply the idea of parallelization to the process of modeling and evaluation. In the calculation process, by assigning tasks to multiple compute nodes, Isolation Forest and Spark can efficiently perform anomaly detection and evaluation process. By this way, we can also solve the problem of computation bottleneck on single machine. Extensive experiments on real world datasets show that our Isolation Forest and Spark is efficient and scales well for anomaly detection on large network traffic data.},

This presents a challenge for traffic measurement, especially for analysis and anomaly detection methods, which are dependent on the type of network traffic. In this paper, we survey existing approaches for classification and analysis of encrypted traffic. First, we describe the most widespread encryption protocols used throughout the Internet. We show that the initiation of an encrypted connection and the protocol structure give away much information for encrypted traffic classification and analysis. Then, we survey payload and feature-based classification methods for encrypted traffic and categorize them using an established taxonomy. The advantage of some of described classification methods is the ability to recognize the encrypted application protocol in addition to the encryption protocol. Finally, we make a comprehensive comparison of the surveyed feature-based classification methods and present their weaknesses and strengths. Copyright {\copyright} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Encrypted network traffic is usually analysed by statistical methods because Deep Packet Inspection or pattern matching is not applicable. However, the statistical methods are usually designed to work offline on already captured network traffic. For real-time analysis, hardware acceleration is needed to achieve wire-speed 10 Gbps throughput. Therefore, we focus on real-time monitoring of encrypted network traffic and propose a new acceleration method to extract features from encrypted network data. Approximate computing is used to speed up the computation of entropy for the input data stream and to reduce FPGA logic utilization. As can be seen in the results, the precision of classification has decreased only by 0.1 to 0.2. Moreover, proposed hardware architecture has very low FPGA logic utilization and can operate on high frequency.},

Network virtualization based on software-defined networking (SDN-NV) in clouds makes it possible to realize programmable virtual networks; consequently, this technology offers many benefits to cloud services for tenants. However, to the best of our knowledge, network monitoring, which is a prerequisite for managing and optimizing virtual networks, has not been investigated in the context of SDN-NV systems. As the first framework for network monitoring in SDN-NV, we identify three challenges: non-isolated and inaccurate statistics, high monitoring delay, and excessive control channel consumption for gathering statistics. To address these challenges, V-Sight introduces three key mechanisms: 1) statistics virtualization for isolated statistics, 2) transmission disaggregation for reduced transmission delay, and 3) pCollector aggregation for efficient control channel consumption. The evaluation results reveal that V-Sight successfully provides accurate and isolated statistics while reducing the monitoring delay and control channel consumption in orders of magnitude. We also show that V-Sight can achieve a data plane throughput close to that of non-virtualized SDN.},
